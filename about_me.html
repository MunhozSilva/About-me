        <p>My name is Luciano Munhoz Silva, a nerd that also love to exercise!</p>        
        <p>I was born in 1995, and since I was a child I've been always close to new technologies.</p>
        <p>Luckily, I had the opportunity to enjoy the new 3D generation of graphics when Xbox was released.</p> 
        <p>Then, I got into new touchscreen trend as soon as the firsts models were invented.</p>
        <p>Those were my first steps into a new era. The digital era.</p>
        <p>And now, we are starting to evolve into the Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality world.</p>
        <p>As always, I won't stay out of this.</p>
        <h2 class="cartao__titulo">Knowledge</h2>
        <p>I studied Control and Automation Engineering at Federal University of Itajub√° - UNIFEI. Which is a very traditional engineering university in Brazil.</p>
        <p>It was founded in 1913 and has been updated ever since.</p>
        <p>During college, I was able to experience various branches of technology, such as:</p>
        <div class="cartao__list">
            <ul>
                <li>PLC programming</li>
                <li>Modern control</li>
                <li>Internet of Things</li>
                <li>Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Network protocols</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Robotics</li>
                <li>Sensors</li>
                <li>Software development</li>
                <li>Telecommunications</li>
                <li>Microprocessors</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="cartao__titulo">Interests</h2>
        <p>Among the experiences I had at the university, the software and data area were the ones that most caught my attention.</p>
        <p>After all, software and data have infinite possibilities of use.</p>
        <p>In addition, this branch is constantly evolving, which catches my attention.</p>  
        <p>The Android platform is the operating system I studied deeper, due to the versatility that this system offers.</p>    
        <p>Also, I'm a machine learning and virtual reality enthusiast.</p>
        <p>I believe that these technologies have enormous potential to be explored.</p>
